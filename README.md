# Financial Tracker

## Overview
The application is a web-based financial tracker. The users can manage their income and expenses through the application to track their financials and make better decisions. 

Users will be able to perform the following:
- sign-up.
- login/logout.
- edit profile and upload a profile picture.
- add/remove currencies.
- manage income/expense records (create, view, update, delete).
- view total balance (per currency).
- view balance over a certain period (per currency).
- exchange amount from one currency to another by providing an exchange rate (will remove the amount from the first currency and add the equivalent to the second currency).
